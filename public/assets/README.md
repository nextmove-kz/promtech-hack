### Image Requirements:
- **Format**: PNG
- **Recommended size**: 1200-1600px wide (landscape orientation)
- **Content**: Full Kazakhstan territory with pipeline routes and markers
- **Usage**: This image will be used in the PDF general report instead of dynamically generating the map

### Location:

```

The image should show:
- Full Kazakhstan territory
